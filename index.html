        <p>Hullo dahlings! I'm Alexa, and I have very strong views on the proper habitat for my gorgeousness, which involve hovering servants (you), a warm spot to rest on (your lap), and luxurious accommodations (your bed). Since despite my many wonderful qualities I lack opposable thumbs, you'll have to do the clicking for both of us.</p>

        <p>Fish gotta swim... birds gotta fly... I gotta sing and sing until I FIND MY FOREVER HOME WITH YOU! (Fooled ya, didn't I?) I'm Daisy, and I'm so full of love that my foster mom says I'd be a great therapy dog, because apparently the opera is not hiring just now. Want to sing along?</p>

        <p>I was saying to myself just this morning, "Lani," I said, "Lani, you know what you need? You need a person all your own." So I sat down to write this post for the nice Shelter Pet Project people, because apparently that's the kind of thing they do - find nice people for extremely intelligent and lovable, slightly senior kitties who are...I shudder to type this...LAPLESS. That's right: I have no lap to call my own. Could you be persuaded to volunteer yours?</p>
